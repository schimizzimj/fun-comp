life is life
go for it
that's all folks
you only live once
how about them apples
here's looking at you kid
we're gonna need a bigger boat
you talking to me?
that's how the cookie crumbles
do you feel lucky, punk?
go irish!
luke I am your father
just do it
yesterday you said tomorrow
don't let your dreams be dreams
