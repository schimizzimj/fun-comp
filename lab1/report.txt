From a user's perspective, the program is quite simple 
in nature. A user enters the charges of two particles 
and the distance between them. Then, the program will output 
the electric force (in Newtons).

From a programmer's perspective, the program first simply initializes 
all of the needed variables for constants and for user inputs. Then, 
the program asks the user for the charge of the first particle in 
Coulombs, the charge of the second particle, and the distance between 
the two particles. Then, the program multiplies k and the charge of 
the two particles, before dividing by the distance squared to get the 
electric force. Finally, the program outputs the force to the user.

I tested the program by running various numbers through the program, 
and doing the same calculations on a calculator as well. Then, I 
compared the two for each set of numbers. The program has run correctly 
for every set of numbers run through during testing. However, in instances of 
long/repeating decimals the program will likely encounter issues.
